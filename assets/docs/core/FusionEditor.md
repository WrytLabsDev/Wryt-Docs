## HTML5 Standards and Best Practices

Fusion Editor is designed with a focus on producing clean, accessible, and semantically correct HTML5 content. Here are the guidelines and best practices that Fusion Editor enforces:

### 1. Semantic HTML

- **Use Proper HTML Elements:**
  - `<p>` for paragraphs.
  - `<h1>` to `<h6>` for headings.
  - `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<li>` for lists.
  - `<blockquote>` for block quotes.
  - `<code>` or `<pre>` for code snippets.
  - Avoid using `<div>` and `<span>` unless necessary for layout or styling.

- **Encourage Best Practices:**
  - Guide users to use proper heading levels, starting with `<h1>` and nesting logically.
  - Use semantic elements like `<strong>` and `<em>` instead of `<b>` and `<i>`.

### 2. Accessibility

- **ARIA Compliance:**
  - Support ARIA roles and attributes where necessary.
  - Ensure elements like forms, tables, and images include appropriate `aria-label`, `alt`, and `title` attributes.

- **Keyboard Navigation:**
  - All editing actions can be performed using the keyboard.
  - The editor is fully navigable with screen readers.

- **Heading Structure:**
  - Enforce a logical heading structure, crucial for screen reader users.

### 3. Clean and Structured HTML

- **Avoid Redundant Wrapping:**
  - Prevent unnecessary nesting of elements (e.g., avoid wrapping a `<p>` inside a `<div>` unless required).

- **Minimal Inline Styles:**
  - Encourage the use of CSS classes over inline styles for consistency and maintainability.

### 4. Content Flexibility

- **Markdown Conversion:**
  - Ensure clean conversion between Markdown and HTML without losing content integrity.

- **Block Editor Features:**
  - Encourage the use of blocks for organizing content, like quotes, code, and images.

### 5. HTML5 Compliance

- **Use HTML5 Doctype:**
  - Ensure content produced is compliant with HTML5 standards.

- **Media Elements:**
  - Support modern media elements like `<video>`, `<audio>`, and `<figure>`.
  - Encourage the use of `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` for images with captions.

### 6. Best Practices for Div and Paragraph Usage

- **Div for Layout, P for Text:**
  - Use `<div>` for layout purposes only, ensuring it doesnâ€™t disrupt the semantic flow.
  - Enforce the use of `<p>` for text content.

- **Block-Level Considerations:**
  - Ensure block-level elements like `<div>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<aside>` are used correctly for structuring content.

### 7. Modular and Extensible Design

- **Customization:**
  - Allow users to define their own styles and templates while enforcing the semantic structure.
  - Provide options to extend or customize the editor with plugins or extensions adhering to these standards.

Fusion Editor is designed to produce clean, accessible, and semantically correct content that adheres to HTML5 standards. By following these best practices, Fusion Editor ensures that the content created is of the highest quality, compatible across platforms, and accessible to all users.
